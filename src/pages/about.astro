	<h2>My Journey</h2>
	
	<h3>Academic Foundations</h3>
	<p>
		My journey began at UC Berkeley, where I studied Computer Science and dove deep into security and systems research. 
		I published papers at top-tier academic conferences and was accepted to Stanford's CS PhD program. 
		But I realized I wanted to build systems, not just study them — so I left before enrolling to pursue industry impact.
	</p>
	<p>
		During this period, I created <a href="https://github.com/ryanra/rustos">RustOS</a>, an experimental operating system written in Rust when the language was still in its infancy. 
		This project combined my academic interest in systems with hands-on implementation at the lowest levels.
	</p>

	<h3>Practical Technical Depth</h3>
	<p>
		At VMware, I engineered core networking components for their NSX virtualization platform. 
		Then at Google, I spent six years on large-scale systems protecting 4B+ users.
		I supported Google's security chief on Chrome protection for macOS and led efforts to convert internal services into revenue-generating products.
		This blend of production scale and systems expertise shaped my pragmatic approach to engineering.
	</p>

	<h3>Zero to One</h3>
	<p>
		As CTO and cofounder at Tavoro, I applied everything I'd learned to build a warehouse management system from scratch. 
		We took it from idea to production with paying customers who relied on us for every aspect of their daily operations. 
		This experience taught me that technical excellence means nothing without product-market fit and a team that can execute.
	</p>

	<h2>What's Next</h2>
	<p>
		I'm exploring opportunities in AI infrastructure and developer tooling at companies with strong engineering cultures. 
		The rapid evolution of AI is creating fascinating challenges around scale, reliability, and developer experience — exactly the kind of problems I enjoy solving.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the side, I'm building <a href="https://typegres.com">Typegres</a>, a next-generation TypeScript query builder that combines SQL's power with TypeScript's type safety. 
		It required diving deep into TypeScript's type system and SQL semantics to create something that feels natural while being fundamentally more powerful than existing solutions.
	</p>

	<h2>Philosophy</h2>
	<p>
		I believe in first principles that work in practice: deeply understanding the problem space, then choosing boring technology that solves it, optimizing for developer productivity, and building systems that are simple to understand and maintain. 
		Too many teams chase shiny new tools when proven solutions would serve them better.
