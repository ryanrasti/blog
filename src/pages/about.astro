	description="Ryan Rasti - From scaling systems to 4B+ users at Google to co-founding a startup as CTO. The journey of a product-minded systems engineer building the future of developer tools."
	pubDate={new Date('October 8 2025')}

	I'm a software engineer and founder who builds tools that empower developers and scale to billions of users.
	My passion is translating deep technical insights into products that solve real-world problems.	

	<h2>From Theory to Scale</h2>
	<p>
		My journey began with a deep dive into theory at <strong>UC Berkeley</strong> and in systems and security research, 
		leading to publications at top-tier conferences and acceptance into <strong>Stanford's CS PhD program</strong>.  
		But I realized I wanted to build systems, not just study them. I left academia before enrolling to pursue industry
		impact. During this period, I created <a href="https://github.com/ryanra/rustos">RustOS</a>,
		an experimental operating system in Rust's earliest days, to bridge the gap between theory and practice.
	</p>
	<p>
		At <strong>VMware</strong>, I engineered core networking components for their NSX virtualization platform. 
		Then at <strong>Google</strong>, I spent six years on large-scale systems protecting 4B+ users.
		I supported Google's security chief on Chrome protection for macOS and rose to Tech Lead as I led efforts to convert internal services into revenue-generating products.
	</p>

	<h3>From Zero to One</h3>
	<p>
		As CTO and cofounder at Tavoro, I fused this deep technical experience with a product-first mindset.
		We built a mission-critical warehouse management system from the ground up, taking it from a whiteboard idea to a production service
		that paying customers relied on every minute of their operations. 
		This experience taught me the most important lesson: the most elegant code is that which solves a real customer problem
		and enables a business to thrive. 
	</p>

	<h2>What's Next: The Future of Developer Experience</h2>
	<p>
		My focus is now on the next frontier: <strong>AI infrastructure</strong>'s overlap with developer tools. The rapid evolution of AI is creating fascinating challenges around scale, reliability, and developer experience â€” exactly the kind of problems I'm built for.
	</p>
	<p>
		My current project, <a href="https://typegres.com">Typegres</a>, is the first step in this direction. It's a next-generation TypeScript query builder designed to solve the trade-off between SQL's power and
		full type safety, in the context of AI-assisted development.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm looking to partner with ambitious people and teams that share this vision. If you're building category-defining tools
		for developers or tackling hard problems in AI infrastructure, let's connect.
